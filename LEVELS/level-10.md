# Level 10 — Escape! (Final Proof) 🎉

This is the final step. You will create your proof file.

## Task
1) Find the FINAL CODE WORD:
- Look in your `answers.md`
- Combine the clue from Level 3 and the chest code from Level 6 like this:

`FINAL-CODE-WORD = <LEVEL3CLUE>-<CHESTCODE>`

Example:
If Level 3 clue is `SUNSET-19` and chest code is `FOX-7`,
Final becomes:
`SUNSET-19-FOX-7`

2) Create your completion file:
`COMPLETED/<your-github-username>.md`

Copy the template from:
`FINAL/FINISH_TEMPLATE.md`

Fill it up completely, including the code word.

3) In `answers.md`, add:
`LEVEL 10 COMPLETE: I submitted my proof`

## Final Commit & Push
```bash
git add COMPLETED/<your-github-username>.md answers.md
git commit -m "FINAL: completed Git Quest"
git push
