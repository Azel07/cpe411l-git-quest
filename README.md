# Git Quest: Escape the Repository 🧩🚪

Welcome! You are “locked” inside this repo. Each level is a small puzzle that teaches a Git/GitHub skill.

✅ **Your mission:** solve Levels 1–10 in order, then push your final proof to GitHub.

---

## What you will practice
- Forking & cloning a repository
- Editing files
- `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
- Viewing commit history (`git log`)
- Creating branches & switching branches
- Using GitHub Pull Requests (in your fork)
- Optional challenge: solving a mini merge conflict (guided)

---

## Submission (How your instructor will mark you DONE)
When you finish, you must create and push this file:

`COMPLETED/<your-github-username>.md`

Use the template here:
`FINAL/FINISH_TEMPLATE.md`

Then commit with message:
**`FINAL: completed Git Quest`**
and push to GitHub.

Finally, submit your repo link (or PR link if asked) to your instructor.

---

## Rules
- Do **not** copy someone else’s completion file.
- You may ask for hints, but you must do your own commits.
- Commit after each level (at least 10 commits total).
